## Creating a sticky nav (bar that sticks to top of page when scrolling)

# TIL:

#### 1. In CSS, max-width

- animates (transitions) width of something, whereas regular width cannot

#### 2. When making a nav stick, take care to remember the extra space it leaves behind

- paddingTop - set document's paddingTop to the nav's offsetHeight to mitigate the spacial problem.
