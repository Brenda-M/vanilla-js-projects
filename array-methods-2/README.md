# # Using Array Methods ( .some() , .every() , .find() , .findIndex(), slice())

# TIL:

#### 1. .some() tests if at least 1 element in an array passes.

#### 2. .every() is same to some(), except all elements must pass.

#### 3. .find() is same as filter, except outputs the 1 element that is needed.

#### 4. .findIndex() returns index of 1st element that satisfies testing function.

#### 5. .slice() is similar to splice, except returns extracted parts into a new array

        - original array isn't changed
