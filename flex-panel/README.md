# Flexbox

# TIL:

#### 1. :first-child is a pseudo-class that targets the first child of its parent.

        - for example, :nth-child(2) selects the second child of the parent element.

#### 2. Below keeps the box-sizing the same in an event change or not

        - *, *:before, *:after { box-sizing: inherit;}

#### 3. border-box in box-sizing keeps padding, margin, etc. within a container, unlike content-box.

#### 4. Don't add '()' to end of a function (like here in the addEventListener function) if you don't want to run it on page load
